# Automation-projects

Welcome to my portfolio of automation and AI-driven projects.
I specialize in building automated workflows** using tools like python, n8n, OpenAI, APIs, and webhooks to save time, boost productivity, and power smart marketing strategies.


## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Ayotomiwa ‚Äî a self-taught automation specialist learning by building.  
My goal is to *automate repetitive tasks*, integrate tools, and build AI agents that actually solve real problems. This repo is a living showcase of the things I‚Äôve built as I grow in this space.


##  Tools Used

- n8n (low-code automation)
- OpenAI API (for summaries, responses, and smart agents)
- REST APIs & Webhooks
- Python (for custom logic when needed)
- Notion, Airtable, Slack, Telegram, Twitter, Discord integrations
