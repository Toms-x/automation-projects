AI-Powered Reddit Lead Generation and Ad Creation
This workflow automates the entire process of finding hyper-targeted leads on Reddit and turning their exact pain points into ready-to-use marketing assets.
I was scrolling through X the other day and stumbled upon a fascinating post about a new way for companies to find leads on Reddit. It described an automated workflow where a business simply provides a product description, and the system intelligently scours Reddit to find users discussing relevant pain points and frustrations. By pinpointing these conversations, the tool allows companies to bypass cold outreach and instead engage directly with potential customers who are already describing the exact problems their product solves, essentially serving up a list of highly qualified leads ready to be converted.
This workflow is the implementation of that idea.
How It Works: From Pain Point to Final Ad
This workflow is a multi-step pipeline that uses AI to automate market research, copywriting, and creative direction.
Input and keyword extraction: The process starts when you submit a simple form with your brand name, website, and product description. An AI model analyzes the description to extract a core "pain point" keyword (1-3 words) that a potential customer might use on Reddit.
Reddit research and filtering: The workflow uses this keyword to search all of Reddit for relevant posts. It then filters these results, keeping only discussions that have meaningful engagement (more than 2 upvotes) and actual text content.
AI relevance classification: Each filtered post is passed to a second AI agent. This agent reads the post in the context of your product and determines if it's a genuinely relevant conversation where a customer is expressing a need your product can solve.
Ad angle generation: All the verified, relevant Reddit posts are aggregated into a single list. A "copywriter" AI then reads this list of real-world frustrations and generates 10 unique, punchy marketing messages or ad angles that frame your product as the solution.
Creative direction: The best ad angles are then sent to a "creative director" AI. This agent's job is to write detailed prompts for an image generator, describing a 4-panel comic strip that visually tells the story of the customer's pain point and the product's solution.
Image generation and storage: Finally, the workflow loops through each comic strip prompt, sending it to DALL-E 3 to generate the image. The final 4-panel comic ad is then automatically saved to a designated folder in your Google Drive.
What This Workflow Delivers
All this workflow need from you is a product description, and you will receive a complete set of marketing assets in your Google Drive, including:
A list of ranked, persuasive ad angles based on real customer conversations.
Creative prompts for visual ad campaigns.
Ready-to-post 4-panel comic strip images that are perfect for social media marketing.
This allows you to move from tedious manual research to an automated system that not only finds your target audience but also creates the ads for them.
