# automation-projects

Welcome to my portfolio of automation and AI-driven projects.
I specialize in building automated workflows** using tools like python, n8n, OpenAI, APIs, and webhooks to save time, boost productivity, and power smart marketing strategies.


## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Tom — a self-taught automation enthusiast learning by building.  
My goal is to *automate repetitive tasks*, integrate tools, and build AI agents that actually solve real problems. This repo is a living showcase of the things I’ve built as I grow in this space.


# 🧠 Tools I Use

- 🧩 n8n (low-code automation)
- 🤖 OpenAI API (for summaries, responses, and smart agents)
- 🌐 REST APIs & Webhooks
- 🐍 Python (for custom logic when needed)
- 🗂 ️ Notion, Airtable, Slack, Telegram, Twitter, Discord integrations
